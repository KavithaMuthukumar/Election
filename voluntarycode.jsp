		</p>

		<p>
			(ii)<span> </span>Social Media platforms have created a high priority
			dedicated <span> </span>grievance redressal channel for taking
			expeditions action on the cases <span> </span>reported by the <abbr
				title="Election Commission of India">ECI</abbr>.<span> </span>
		</p>

		<p>
			(iii)<span> </span>Social Media Platforms and <abbr
